## Hello there!

I'm a frontend developer mainly working with Vue. I am a veteran with jQuery (I was a part of the WordPress 5 team last year) so it's definitely worth your time to get in touch with me about changes within a given project. As a developer, especially as a single user, I'm not usually much for surprises, but sometimes I am happy to get an opportunity to write something new in front of some other developers.

If you want your design to be beautiful, your frontend needs to be capable of handling JavaScript, CSS, and JavaScript performance tests. On top of that, your frontend needs to be able to test against the newest release of jQuery, an open-source library that offers a variety of pre-compiled API specific test suites.
